## Getting Started

Install Bun if you don't already have it:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### Server quickstart

```bash
bun create github.com/brandon-schabel/bnk-server-starter
```

```bash
cd bun-server-starter
```

```bash
bun dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser and you should see Hello world and
`http://localhost:3000/json` for the json

## Usage Overview

### Install

```bash
bun add @bnk/core
```

Use any an all Bun Nook Kit modules - server example with json response (similar to starter project)

`index.ts`

```typescript
import * as bnk from "@bnk/core";

const routes = {
  "/": {
    // parse from request if neeeded
    GET: (request) => new Response("Hello World!")
  },
  "/json": {
    GET: request => bnk.server.jsonRes({
      message: "Hello JSON Response!"
    })
  }
} satisfies bnk.server.Routes

const { start, routes } = bnk.server.serverFactory({
  routes
});


// start on default port 3000
start()
```

Note:
The keyword satisfies in TypeScript, gives us typesafety, if you have middleware it would even infer the response from those! Which can then be passed to the routes and used in the handlers. So instead of explicitly saying routes is a specific type, it just makes sure that type(Routes in this case) can be succesfully applied to that object/array/whatever(routes config in this case), since it doesn't specifically set the type, we can then infer all the types from the middleware and routes. Following this it makes it possible to make typesafe API
requests.

## Key Highlights

- **Zero Third Paty Dependencies** - BNK uses nothin' but Bun
  
- **Unit Tested** - To ensure BNK is reliable, changeable, and upgradeable.

- **TypeSafe with Strong TypeScript type Inferencing** - Strong types tell you where things are incorrect, strong type inferrence allows you to utilize the advantages of strong types and not having to deal with too much TypeScript.

- **Modular** Everything is built with as little dependency other other modules in the repo, however they still work together. Soon I'll be working on a full stack auth package which will utilize everything from server routes, cookies, database(sqlite).

- **Builds on Web APIs** Bun itself is built on strong principles of sticking to Web APIs In order to maintain as much comptaibility across various packages, BNK sticks to the fundementals of the webplatform APIs.

## Plugins

Currently Bun Nook Kit has a React plugin, as well as a hook called `useServerState` for connecting to a Bun Nook Kit websocket server state, a `useLocalStorage` hook, and a `useClipboard` hook.

## Architecture

Bun Nook Kit is built upon a robust and flexible architecture using factory functions, taking full advantage of their benefits to offer a streamlined, efficient, and versatile toolkit for your development needs.

- **Encapsulation**: Bun Nook Kit employs factory functions to streamline object creation, concealing the complexity of the process and offering a user-friendly interface. This enables you to utilize module functionalities without delving into the detailed construction logic.

- **Adaptability**: Factory functions in Bun Nook Kit are engineered to return varied object types, dependent on input parameters, ensuring the toolkit can be precisely adapted to meet your project's unique requirements.

- **Code Reusability**: Adhering to functional programming principles, Bun Nook Kit‚Äô factory functions facilitate efficient code management and hasten development through enabling code reusability and composability.

- **Object Initialization**: Bun Nook Kit' factory functions manage complex object initialization, ensuring modules are instantiated with necessary properties or states.

Moreover, Bun Nook Kit employs factory functions to inject additional context where needed. For example, in the files folder module, a base path can be specified to anchor all operations to a particular directory. In the fetcher‚Äôs case, it allows the provision of a TypeSafe interface to the module, enabling type-safe fetch requests throughout your project. It also enhances user experience and usability by providing intellisense for available functions in the module. Although Bun Nook Kit heavily utilizes factory functions, almost all functions within them can also be used directly.

This version aims to maintain the original meaning while enhancing clarity and grammatical structure. Let me know if further modifications are needed!

## Example Projects

## Alpha Software

Please use at your own risk, this is alpha software and is still very much in the early stages and the APIs are **guranteed** to change.

## Coming Soon

### Stacks ü•û

I have a few templates for building full stack apps in the works.

1. BNK Payments Stack - Use BNKs built in HTMLody and it's CSS engine to create interactive full stack applications with payments and auth preconfigured.
2. BNK SSR React With Client Side Hydration with Auth - A Stack that will come preconfigurated with a full stack SSR'd BNK based server plugin. This allows you to take full advantage of the existing React ecosystem.
3. Decoupled Client/Server with Auth

### Finalize V1 APIs

Close To Final For V1:

- Server
- SQLite
- UUID
- JWT
- Cookies
- HTMLody/CSS-Engine
- Fetcher

### Dev Tools

### Use JS Libraries Like React Anywhere in HTMLody

### Better handling for Server Sent Events in Server, Fetcher, etc
