# Types Module

## Overview

The Types Module is a part of the CLI Utils library, which provides a fast, dependency-less command-line utility built with the following technologies:

- Bun
- TypeScript

The goal of the Types Module is to offer a set of reusable and modular type definitions that can be used in various projects without relying on numerous external dependencies.

## Features

- Strongly typed definitions for various data structures and objects
- Easy integration with other CLI Utils modules
- Simplifies code maintenance and improves readability

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install the CLI Utils library, which includes the Types Module, run:

bashCopy code

`bun install`

### Running

To start using the Types Module with CLI Utils, run:

bashCopy code

`bun run index.ts`

## Usage

Import the required type definitions from the Types Module into your project and use them as needed. The Types Module is designed to be modular, unit testable, and only export things that are worth using outside the module.

Example:

typescript

`import { MyType } from 'cli-utils/types';

function processData(data: MyType) {
// Your implementation here
}`

## Contributing

Contributions to the Types Module and CLI Utils are welcome! Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the following guidelines:

- Only use Bun as a dependency.
- Build everything from scratch in a reusable way.
- If a feature becomes overly complicated, create a new version.
- Maintain a flat hierarchy within modules.
