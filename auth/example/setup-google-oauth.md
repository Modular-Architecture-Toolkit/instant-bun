### Google OAuth Setup Guide

#### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. **Go to the Google Cloud Console**: Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

2. **Create a New Project**: Click on the 'Select a project' dropdown near the top of the page, then click 'New Project'. Give your project a name and click 'Create'.

#### Step 2: Configure the OAuth Consent Screen

1. **Open the Credentials Page**: In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the 'Credentials' page under 'APIs & Services'.

2. **Configure Consent Screen**: Click on 'Configure Consent Screen'. You'll be asked to choose a user type (choose 'External' for testing purposes). Click 'Create'.

3. **Fill Out Consent Screen Details**: Enter the necessary information:
   - App name
   - User support email
   - Developer contact email
   - Optionally, you can add a logo, application homepage link, privacy policy link, and terms of service link.

4. **Save and Continue**: After filling out the necessary details, click 'Save and Continue'.

#### Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. **Create Credentials**: Go back to the 'Credentials' page, and click 'Create Credentials' at the top. Select 'OAuth client ID'.

2. **Application Type**: Choose the application type that best represents your application. For web applications, select 'Web application'.

3. **Set Authorized Redirect URIs**: Under 'Authorized redirect URIs', click 'Add URI' and enter the redirect URI your application will use (/callback). This is the URI where Google will send responses to your OAuth requests.

4. **Create**: Click 'Create'. Google will then generate your client ID and client secret.

#### Step 4: Note Down Your Credentials

1. **Copy the Client ID and Client Secret**: Once created, you'll see a dialog showing your client ID and client secret. Copy these values as you will need them to configure your application.

#### Step 5: Enable Required APIs

1. **Enable APIs**: If your application requires access to specific Google APIs (like Gmail, Google Calendar, etc.), go to the 'Library' in the Google Cloud Console, search for the necessary APIs, and enable them for your project.

#### Step 6: Implement OAuth in Your Application

1. **Use Credentials in Your App**: Use the client ID and client secret in your application's OAuth configuration.

2. **Handle Redirects**: Make sure your application can handle redirects from Google and can exchange the authorization code for an access token.

#### Step 7: Testing and Deployment

1. **Test the OAuth Flow**: Thoroughly test the OAuth flow in your application to ensure everything is working as expected.

2. **Submit for Verification**: If your application will be used by users outside your organization, you must submit your OAuth consent screen for verification by Google.

3. **Deploy Your Application**: Once everything is tested and verified, you can deploy your application.

### Conclusion

This guide provides a basic overview of setting up Google OAuth for a new application. Depending on your specific needs and the APIs you intend to use, there may be additional configuration steps. Always ensure that you follow best practices for security and user privacy.
