# Contributing to U Tools

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/brandon-schabel/instant-bun/issues); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's [an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report. The more information you provide, the easier it is for us to validate that there is a bug and to figure out how to fix it.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We recommend using a linter, and you can use the .eslintrc.json in the repo for guidance.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
