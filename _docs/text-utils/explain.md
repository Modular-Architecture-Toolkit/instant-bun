This file is a TypeScript module that exports several functions to convert raw Markdown text into formatted HTML. It depends on the built-in regular expression support in JavaScript.

Features of the module include:

- Converting different types of Markdown syntax into HTML tags, such as headers, bold and italic text, links, unordered and ordered lists, blockquotes, code blocks and inline code.
- Generating HTML code that conforms to proper indentation rules and tag nesting.
- Prettifying raw HTML code by indenting nested tags properly.

The main function in the module, `convertMarkdownToHTML`, takes raw Markdown text as an input and returns the equivalent HTML code as a string. The module also exports some utility functions for replacing and parsing specific Markdown syntax, as well as a helper function for prettifying raw HTML code. To use this module, a developer would import it into their TypeScript codebase and call the relevant functions from within their code.
