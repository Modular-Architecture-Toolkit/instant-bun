This file contains two main functions: "prettifyHTMLString" and "convertMarkdownToHTML", as well as a helper function "replaceMarkdown" and an object with various parsers for different markdown elements. 

Dependencies: This module does not appear to depend on any other modules.

"prettifyHTMLString": This function takes a raw HTML string and formats it by adding indentation and line breaks to make it more human-readable. It achieves this by using regular expressions to parse through the HTML tags, identifying opening and closing tags and their corresponding attributes, and then adding appropriate spacing and line breaks to the formatted output.

"convertMarkdownToHTML": This function takes a raw markdown string and converts it to HTML. It does this by iterating through an object of parsers for different markdown elements (such as headers, bold/italic text, links, lists, etc.), and applying the appropriate parser to the markdown string. Once all the parsers have been applied, the resulting string is returned as HTML.

"replaceMarkdown": This is a helper function used by the various parsers in "convertMarkdownToHTML". It takes a text string, a regular expression to match, and a replacement string, and applies the regular expression to the text string, replacing any matches with the replacement string.

Overall, this module provides functionality for converting and formatting HTML and markdown strings.
