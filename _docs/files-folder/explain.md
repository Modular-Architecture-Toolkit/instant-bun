This file is a collection of utility functions for working with files and directories in a Node.js application. 

Modules it depends on:
- fs: a built-in Node.js module for interacting with the file system
- path: a built-in Node.js module for working with file and directory paths

Features of the module:
- `getFilesForDirectory`: given a directory path, returns an array of file names (without extensions) within that directory, optionally ignoring specified files
- `getFilesForDirectoryFromRoot`: given a directory path relative to the root of the application (determined by searching upwards for a 'tsconfig.json' file), returns an array of file names (without extensions) within that directory, optionally ignoring specified files
- `isRootFolder`: determines whether a given path represents the root directory of the application (in this case, by checking for the presence of a 'tsconfig.json' file)
- `findAppRoot`: given a starting path, searches upward for the application root directory (see `isRootFolder` for definition)
- `saveResultToFile`: given a file path and contents, creates any necessary directories and writes the contents to the file
- `readFilesContents`: given an array of file paths, returns an array of objects containing the file name and contents

Technical description:
This file defines several functions that interact with the file system using the `fs` module and manipulate file paths using the `path` module. These functions can be used in a Node.js application to perform file-related tasks, such as finding files in a directory, reading file contents, and saving results to a file. Some of the functions are designed to work relative to the application root directory, which is determined by searching upwards for a specific file ('tsconfig.json' in this case) using the `findAppRoot` function. The `saveResultToFile` function also creates any directories needed to write to the specified file path. Overall, these functions provide useful utility for working with files and directories in a Node.js application.
