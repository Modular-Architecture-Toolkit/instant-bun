This file is a module written in TypeScript that provides several functions for working with files and directories. 

Dependencies:
- fs: A module for interacting with the file system.
- path: A module for working with file paths.

Features:
- `getFilesForDirectory`: Returns an array of file names from a specified directory. It takes an optional array of file names to ignore.
- `getFilesForDirectoryFromRoot`: Returns an array of file names from a specified directory relative to the project root directory. It takes an optional array of file names to ignore.
- `isRootFolder`: Checks if a specified directory is the root directory for a project. It currently checks if there is a `tsconfig.json` file present in the directory.
- `findAppRoot`: Starting from a specified directory, finds the project root directory by recursively checking parent directories until it finds the root.
- `saveResultToFile`: Saves a string of content to a specified file path.

Technical description:
The module uses the `fs` and `path` modules to recursively search for files and directories. It makes use of TypeScript syntax, including type annotations and interface definitions to improve code readability and maintainability. The `saveResultToFile` function makes use of the `async` and `await` keywords to work with `promises` returned by the `fs` module's methods. Overall, the module provides useful utility functions for working with files and directories in a TypeScript project.
