## Possible Improvements for Module

- **Add JSDoc documentation:** Adding [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) documentation for every function with its parameter types, return types, and description helps in understanding the code better and increases the readability of the code.

- **Add error handling:** Currently, there is no error handling in the code. Adding error handling can make the code more robust and secure.

- **Use async-await instead of synchronous functions:** The code is currently using synchronous functions which can result in blocking the main thread, especially when dealing with large files. Using asynchronous functions with `async-await` syntax can help in reducing the blocking of the main thread and make the code more efficient.

- **Refactor the code:** Some parts of the code can be refactored to reduce redundancy and simplify the code. For example, the code can be simplified by consolidating similar functions.

- **Use constants instead of hard-coded values:** Instead of using hard-coded values such as `"_apps" | "_tests" | "_docs" | "." | "../" | ".../"`, it's better to use constants that can be reused throughout the code. This makes the code more consistent and easier to maintain.

- **Allow custom file extensions:** The current code only works for files without an extension. Adding an option to allow custom file extensions can make the code more flexible.

- **Add tests:** Adding unit tests can help in ensuring that the code behaves correctly and does not break in different scenarios. This can also help in catching bugs and errors early. 

- **Use a linter:** Using a linter such as [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) can help in enforcing coding standards and best practices. This increases code quality and readability.
