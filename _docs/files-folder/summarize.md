## Module Overview

This module provides functions for working with files and directories, specifically for retrieving file names from a specified directory, identifying the root directory of a project, and saving content to a file.

### Exports

- `getFilesForDirectory(directory: string, options: { ignoreFiles?: string[] }): string[]`: Retrieves a list of file names from the specified directory.
  - `directory`: The directory path to search for files.
  - `options.ignoreFiles`: An optional array of file names to exclude from the results.
- `getFilesForDirectoryFromRoot(directory: string, options: { ignoreFiles?: string[] }): string[]`: Retrieves a list of file names from the specified directory, starting from the root directory of the project.
  - `directory`: The directory path to search for files.
  - `options.ignoreFiles`: An optional array of file names to exclude from the results.
- `isRootFolder(folderPath: string): boolean`: Returns `true` if the provided folder path is the root directory of a project.
  - `folderPath`: The directory path to check.
- `findAppRoot(startingPath: string): string | null`: Uses the provided path to recursively search for the root directory of a project. Returns the root directory path or `null` if not found.
  - `startingPath`: The path to start the search from.
- `saveResultToFile(filePath: string, content: string): Promise<void>`: Writes content to the specified file path. Creates the file and any necessary directories if they do not exist.
  - `filePath`: The path of the file to write to.
  - `content`: The string to write to the file.

Note: Some functions accept a directory path argument with specific string values, such as `_apps` and `_tests`. These are likely project-specific and should be modified or removed for use in other projects.
