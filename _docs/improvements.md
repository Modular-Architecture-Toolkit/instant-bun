## Possible Improvements

- **Add support for more markdown syntax:** The module currently supports only a few markdown syntax elements like headers, bold, italic, links, and lists. Adding support for more markdown syntax like tables, images, code blocks, etc. can provide more functionality to the module.
- **Allow customization of HTML tag names:** Currently, the module generates HTML tags that are fixed for each markdown syntax element. Providing an option to customize the HTML tag names used in the generated HTML can enable users to tailor the output according to their needs.
- **Support for inline HTML:** The module currently does not handle inline HTML in the input string. Adding support for inline HTML can enable users to embed HTML elements within markdown syntax and have them preserved in the output.
- **Linting and error handling:** The module does not have any built-in linting or error handling mechanisms. Adding such mechanisms can help to catch common errors like unclosed markdown syntax elements or invalid markdown syntax and provide error messages that indicate the line number and location of the error.
- **Performance optimization:** The current implementation of the module may not scale well for large input strings with many markdown elements. Optimizing the implementation for performance can improve the speed and memory usage of the module. Techniques like lazy evaluation, avoiding unnecessary memory allocation, and using regular expression optimizations can be employed to achieve better performance.
