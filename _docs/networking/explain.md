Technical Description:
The module creates a fetcher function for making http requests to the API, and a router for defining and handling routes. It then creates a CRUD server for handling API requests, with support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting items. Additionally, it integrates with OpenAI's API for generating completions, using a function to create a completion client with an API key. The module also supports websockets for real-time communication with connected clients.
