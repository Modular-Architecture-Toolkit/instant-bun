- Improve error handling by adding more specific error messages and handling different types of errors separately.
- Consider using a more structured approach to define and validate the API requests and responses using a library like JOI or AJV.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure API endpoints.
- Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the load on the API and improve performance.
- Consider using a more modular approach for the router to allow for better scalability and maintainability.
- Implement unit tests and integration tests using a testing framework like Jest to ensure the reliability and correctness of the module.
- Use a logger library like Winston to improve logging capabilities and make it easier to debug issues.
- Use a linter and code formatter like ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent code style and prevent errors and bugs.
- Consider using a more flexible approach to defining the schema and types to allow for more complex data structures and relationships.
- Explore the possibility of using TypeScript or Flow to add static typing and improve code maintainability and readability.
