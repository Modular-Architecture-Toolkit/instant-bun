This module provides a set of functions to handle Markdown to HTML conversion and prettify HTML code. The most important features of this module are:

1. `prettifyHTMLString`: This function takes a raw HTML string and returns a formatted and indented HTML string. It uses a stack to keep track of opening and closing tags, and updates the indent level accordingly.

2. `replaceMarkdown`: This is a utility function that replaces the Markdown syntax with HTML tags.

3. `parseHeaders`: This function parses Markdown headers and replaces them with `h1` to `h6` HTML tags.

4. `useMdToHtml`: This is a factory function that returns an object with functions to parse various Markdown elements including bold, italic, links, unordered lists, and ordered lists.

5. `replaceMarkdown` and `parseHeaders`: These functions are also exported individually.

6. `templatingEngine`: This is an empty object that can be used to add custom templating functionality. 

List of exports:
- `prettifyHTMLString`
