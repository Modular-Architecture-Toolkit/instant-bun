This module exports a single function: `generateEncryptionKey()`. It generates a random encryption key that consists of 32 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers. The function uses a string of possible characters and a loop with the `Math.random()` function to create the key. The key is then returned as a string.
