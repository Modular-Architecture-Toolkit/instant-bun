## Improvements to the TypeInference module
Here are some possible improvements to make the code more robust, reusable, and maintainable:

### 1. Better error handling
The current implementation of `ValidationResult` only returns an error message if there is an error in the schema. It would be helpful to catch and return more detailed errors if there are issues with the data itself, like data types not matching the schema, missing required fields, or invalid values. 

### 2. Include default values for missing fields
It would be helpful to include a way to specify default values for fields that are missing from the input data, instead of just returning undefined. As a best practice, setting default values can help prevent potential bugs and improve consistency across the returned data.

### 3. Allow for handling nested data types
The current implementation of `TypeMapping` only handles the built-in JavaScript data types, but it would be useful to extend this to more complex types, such as Arrays, Tuples, Objects, and custom types. This would require additional code to recursively check nested types, but would provide greater flexibility in handling more complex data structures.

### 4. Add support for custom validations
Along with type validation, it would be beneficial to allow for custom validation functions to be passed in, to handle more nuanced requirements. For example, this could include checking for minimum and maximum values, regex patterns, enums, and more.

### 5. Provide better typings for data and schema inputs
The current implementation of `infer` and `ValidationResult` takes inputs of `unknown` and `Record<string, keyof TypeMapping>`, respectively, which can be restrictive and error-prone. More specific typings, such as generics, interfaces, or type aliases, could improve readability and reduce errors. 

### 6. Allow for more flexibility in data input
The current implementation requires `data` to be an exact match for the schema, but in some cases it may be useful to allow for partial or non-matching data to be processed, with some fields being ignored or defaulted. Adding an optional flag or parameter could allow for more customization in handling different types of data inputs.
