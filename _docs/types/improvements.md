### Possible improvements for the module:

- Improve the validation mechanism to provide more detailed error messages, such as which field failed validation and why.
- Add support for more data types in the TypeMapping, such as arrays, objects, and enums.
- Provide optional customizable validation rules, such as minimum and maximum values or string length.
- Add support for async validation rules, such as making network requests or querying databases.
- Improve the type checking for the infer function by only allowing valid schema objects to be passed as arguments.
- Include better documentation and examples for how to use the module effectively.
- Incorporate automated testing and continuous integration to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- Provide a way to parse and stringify JSON data that adheres to a given schema.
