## Module: type-inference.ts

**Dependencies:**
- None

**Features:**
- TypeMapping interface: a map of TypeScript types to their corresponding JavaScript types.
- TypeInference type: a utility type that infers TypeScript types from a given schema.
- ValidationResult type: a type that defines the output of the validate function.
- SchemaType type: an interface that defines the schema object structure.
- infer function: a function that infers types from data based on a given schema.

**Description:**
The `type-inference.ts` module is a utility for inferring TypeScript types from data based on a schema object. The module exports several useful types, including `TypeMapping`, which maps TypeScript types to their corresponding JavaScript types; `TypeInference`, which infers TypeScript types based on a given schema; and `ValidationResult`, which specifies the expected output of the `validate` function. The module also exports a function called `infer`, which takes a schema object and data as arguments and returns the inferred TypeScript types. This module is useful for validating data types or ensuring data is properly formatted according to a defined schema.
