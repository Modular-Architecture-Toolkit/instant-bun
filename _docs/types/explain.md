This file defines several types and functions related to validating and inferring TypeScript types from a schema. 

Dependencies:
- TypeMapping: an object with keys representing primitive types and values representing their corresponding TypeScript types
- Date: built-in JavaScript date object

Features:
- TypeMapping: provides a standardized mapping from primitive types to TypeScript types
- TypeInference: a utility type that infers TypeScript types from a provided schema
- ValidationResult: a type that represents the result of validating data against a schema, including an optional error message and type-inferred data
- SchemaType: a type that represents a schema as an object with keys representing field names and values representing primitive types
- infer: a function that infers TypeScript types for data based on a provided schema

Technical Description:
The TypeMapping object provides a mapping between primitive types (such as 'string' or 'boolean') and their corresponding TypeScript types (such as 'string' or 'boolean'). The TypeInference type utilizes this mapping to infer TypeScript types from a provided schema. The ValidationResult type represents the result of validating data against a schema, including an optional error message and type-inferred data. The SchemaType type defines a schema as an object with keys representing field names and values representing primitive types. Finally, the infer function takes a schema and optional data, and returns the type-inferred data.
