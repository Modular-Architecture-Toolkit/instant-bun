There are a few improvements that can be made to this module:

1. **Type Safety:** The module could benefit from better type safety. It currently relies on `any` types in a few places, which can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior.

2. **Error Handling:** The module could improve its error handling. Currently, it relies heavily on throwing errors with messages that aren't very helpful in pinpointing the source of the error.

3. **Documentation:** The module could benefit from better documentation, including JSDoc comments on functions and interfaces, and higher-level documentation describing the purpose and usage of the module.

4. **Testing:** The module could benefit from more comprehensive test coverage, including edge cases and error scenarios.

5. **Modularity:** The module could be broken down into smaller, more focused sub-modules that each handle a specific aspect of JWT authentication. This would make the code easier to read and maintain.
