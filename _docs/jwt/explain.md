This is a TypeScript module that exports two functions: `jwtClient` and `jwtServer`. 

The `jwtClient` function has two sub-functions: `decodeJwt`, which decodes a JWT and returns its header and payload as an object, and `isJwtExpired`, which checks if a given JWT has expired based on its `exp` (expiration time) claim.

The `jwtServer` function has two sub-functions: `createJwt`, which creates a JWT using a given payload, secret key, and expiration time, and `verifyJwt`, which verifies the signature of a given JWT and returns its header and payload.

This module depends on the built-in `crypto` module for hashing and signing.

Features of this module include JWT decoding, creation, and verification, as well as expiration checking. The technical implementation includes encoding and decoding JWT header and payload using Base64 and signing the JWT using a secret key with the HMAC-SHA256 algorithm.
