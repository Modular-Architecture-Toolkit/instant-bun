This file exports two functions, `jwtClient` and `jwtServer`, both of which are related to JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). 

This module depends on Node's built-in `crypto` module for generating HMAC signatures.

### jwtClient

`jwtClient` exports two methods: 

- `decodeJwt(token: string)`: decodes a JWT and returns the header and payload as a JavaScript object.
- `isJwtExpired(token: string)`: decodes a JWT, checks if it has an expiration time, and if so, compares it to the current time to determine if the token is expired.

### jwtServer

`jwtServer` exports two methods:

- `createJwt(payload: JwtPayload, secret: string, expiresIn: number = 60 * 60)`: creates a JWT with an optional expiration time and returns it as a string. The payload is expected to be a JavaScript object, and the `secret` parameter is used to generate the HMAC signature.
- `verifyJwt(token: string, secret: string): { header: JwtHeader, payload: JwtPayload }`: takes a JWT as a string, verifies its signature and expiration time, and returns the decoded header and payload as a JavaScript object.

This module makes use of the `base64UrlEncode` and `base64UrlDecode` functions to encode and decode JWT header and payload strings. It also uses the `sign` function to generate HMAC signatures for verifying and creating JWTs. 

The `JwtHeader` and `JwtPayload` interfaces define the expected shape of JWT headers and payloads. 

Overall, this module provides a convenient way to generate and verify JWTs, which are commonly used in authentication and authorization processes.
