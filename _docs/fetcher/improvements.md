## Improvements to createFetcher module

- **Add support for other HTTP methods**: Currently, the module only supports GET, POST, and HEAD methods. Adding support for other methods such as PUT, DELETE, and PATCH would increase the flexibility of the module.

- **Allow passing of additional fetch options**: The `fetch` function accepts additional options such as `credentials`, `mode`, `cache`, and `redirect`. Passing these options as part of the `FetchOptions` parameter would allow for greater customization of the requests.

- **Handle network errors**: The `fetch` function can fail due to reasons such as network errors, timeouts, or DNS failures. Adding proper error handling for these scenarios can improve the reliability of the module.

- **Better typing for params and headers**: The `params` and `headers` parameters of the `post` function currently accept `any` type arguments. Providing better typing for these parameters can improve type safety and catch potential errors at compile time.

- **Provide better API documentation**: While the module is relatively simple, providing better documentation including examples and explanations of each function's parameters can make it easier for others to use and understand the module.

- **Add support for multiple base URLs**: While the current implementation assumes a single base URL, adding support for multiple base URLs can be useful for scenarios where requests need to be sent to different endpoints.
