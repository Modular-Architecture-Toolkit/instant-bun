### Improvements for DebugPromptOptions
- Instead of using `moduleName`, consider using `fileName` for consistency with the naming convention in the code.
- Consider adding a `lineNumber` property to `DebugPromptOptions` to indicate which line the debug prompt corresponds to. This can be useful in cases where the debug prompt is used for a specific line within a file.

### Improvements for createDebugPromptFromInputOutput function
- Consider adding input and output type definitions to the function signature for improved readability and maintainability.
- Instead of concatenating strings using `+=`, consider using template literals for improved performance and readability.
- Consider adding a check for empty `input` and `output` strings to prevent unnecessary whitespace in the prompt.
- Consider renaming the `output` parameter to `result` for improved clarity.
- Consider adding error handling to the function in case `input` or `result` contain special characters that could break the prompt formatting.
