## Possible Improvements

- Add error handling for when the serial port fails to open.
- Create a more descriptive error message for serial port write errors.
- Allow for optional configuration of serial port options other than "baudRate".
- Consider adding a method to close the serial port connection.
- Add more thorough documentation for the functions and their parameters.
- Implement testing to ensure all functions work as expected.
- Consider adding support for different types of microcontrollers, not just Arduino.
