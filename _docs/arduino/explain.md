## **File Explanation**

This file exports two functions, `createArduinoInterface` and `listPorts`, which work with Arduino devices over a serial port. The `createArduinoInterface` function creates a new interface with the Arduino device using the provided serial port and an optional baud rate. The `listPorts` function lists the available serial ports on the machine.

The file depends on two modules, `error-handler-validation` and `serialport`.

## **Module Features**

### **Function: createArduinoInterface**

This function creates a new interface with the Arduino device using the provided serial port and an optional baud rate. The function returns an object with two methods: `onData` and `write`.

#### **Method: onData**

The `onData` method takes a callback function that is executed every time new data is received from the Arduino device. The data is passed to the callback function as a string parameter.

#### **Method: write**

The `write` method takes a string parameter that is sent to the Arduino device over the serial port. The method returns a Promise that resolves when the data is successfully written to the device, and rejects with an error if the write operation fails.

### **Function: listPorts**

This function lists the available serial ports on the machine. It returns a Promise that resolves with an array of objects, each representing a single available serial port. Each object contains two properties: `path`, which represents the path of the serial port, and `manufacturer`, which represents the manufacturer of the device that is currently connected to the port.

## **Technical Description**

The `createArduinoInterface` function creates a new instance of the `SerialPort` class from the `serialport` module, which is used to establish a connection with the Arduino device over a serial port. The function takes an options object with two properties: `port`, which is the path of the serial port to use, and `baudRate`, which is the rate at which to communicate with the device (optional, defaults to 9600). The function returns an object with two methods: `onData` and `write`.

The `onData` method sets up an event listener on the `data` event of the `SerialPort` object, which is triggered every time new data is received from the device. When the event is triggered, the callback function provided in the `onData` method is executed with the received data passed as a string parameter. If an error occurs in the callback function, the `handleError` function from the `error-handler-validation` module is called with an object containing an error type of "APIError" and the error message.

The `write` method sends data to the Arduino device over the serial port using the `SerialPort` object's `write` method. The method takes a string parameter representing the data to be sent to the device. It returns a Promise that resolves when the data is successfully written to the device, and rejects with an error if the write operation fails. If an error occurs, the `handleError` function is called with an object containing an error type of "APIError" and the error message.

The `listPorts` function utilizes the `list` method from the `serialport` module to list all the available serial ports on the machine. The function maps over the array of ports, creating a new object for each port with the `path` and `manufacturer` properties, and returns an array of these objects. If an error occurs during the listing operation, the `handleError` function is called with an object containing an error type of "APIError" and the error message.
