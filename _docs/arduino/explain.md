# File Explanation

This file exports two functions, `createArduinoInterface` and `listPorts`, and imports three modules, `handleError`, `serialport`, and `SerialPort`.

## Dependencies

This module depends on the following modules:

- `error-handler-validation`: a module that exports a function for handling errors and validating error messages.
- `serialport`: a module that helps with serial communication with an Arduino device.
- `SerialPort`: a constructor for the `serialport` module.

## Features

### `createArduinoInterface`

This function takes an object with two parameters, `port` and `baudRate`, and returns an object with two functions, `onData` and `write`. 

#### `onData`

This function takes a callback function as a parameter and is called every time data is received from the Arduino. The data is converted to a string and passed to the callback function. Any errors thrown by the callback function are caught, and an APIError is thrown using the `handleError` function.

#### `write`

This function takes a string as a parameter and returns a `Promise`. It writes the string to the Arduino and calls the `resolve` function of the promise if successful. If an error occurs, the `reject` function of the promise is called with an APIError using the `handleError` function.

### `listPorts`

This function returns an array of objects containing information about all available ports. It calls the `list` function of the `SerialPort` module to get the list of ports. Any errors are caught, and an APIError is thrown using the `handleError` function. 

## Technical Description 

This module is used to communicate with an Arduino device through a serial port. The `createArduinoInterface` function creates an interface for sending and receiving data to the device. It creates a new `serialport` instance using the provided `port` and `baudRate`, and returns an object with two functions, `onData` and `write`. The `onData` function listens for data from the Arduino device and passes it to the provided callback function. The `write` function writes data to the device.

The `listPorts` function lists all available ports using the `SerialPort` moduleâ€™s `list` function. It returns an array of objects containing the path and manufacturer of each port. 

The `handleError` function is used to handle and validate errors, and is imported from the `error-handler-validation` module.
