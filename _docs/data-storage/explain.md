This module is a utility for creating a SQLite CRUD interface. It depends on the "bun:sqlite" and "./validator" modules. 

Features:
- createTableQuery: a function that takes a table name and schema as arguments and returns a SQL query to create a table in a SQLite database.
- CreateSqliteInterface: a type definition for the CRUD interface.
- createSqliteInterface: a function that takes a table name and schema as arguments and returns a CRUD interface for that table.

The createSqliteInterface function first creates a database instance using "bun:sqlite" and creates a table with the specified schema using createTableQuery. It then defines the necessary CRUD functions for the table by constructing and executing SQL queries. The create function inserts a new record into the table, the read function selects all records from the table and validates them against the schema using the Validator module, the update function updates an existing record in the table, and the deleteById function deletes a record from the table based on its ID. Overall, this module provides a simplified way to interact with a SQLite database using TypeScript.
