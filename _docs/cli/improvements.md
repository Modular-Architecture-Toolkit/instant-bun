## Improvements to the Module

- **Use TypeScript for type safety:** The module should be converted to TypeScript for better type safety and to improve code readability. This will also make it easier to maintain in the future.

- **Use async/await instead of callbacks:** The current implementation uses callbacks to handle file system operations. It should be updated to use `async/await` instead, which is a more modern approach and improves readability and code structure.

- **Add error handling for file system operations:** The module should have proper error handling in place for file system operations. This will help to avoid issues like missing file errors, permission errors, etc.

- **Improve directoryExists():** `directoryExists` function should check if the directory already exists before creating it to avoid unnecessary errors or overwriting existing directories.

- **Use path.join() instead of concatenation:** Instead of using concatenation for directory paths, the `path.join()` method should be used. This will ensure that paths are correctly formatted for different platforms.

- **Extract constants to config file:** Important constants like file paths, settings, or configuration parameters should be extracted to a configuration file to make it easier to manage and modify.

- **Ensure backward compatibility:** Any changes to the API or module should be made in a way that ensures backward compatibility with existing code that uses the module.

- **Add unit tests:** The current implementation lacks unit tests. Adding unit tests will help ensure the correctness of the module's implementation and prevent regressions.
