## Possible Improvements

- Add proper type annotations for all functions and arguments to improve code readability and maintainability.
- Use `const` instead of `let` whenever possible to avoid unintentional mutations of values.
- Add proper error handling for functions that can potentially throw errors, such as `fs.writeFileSync` and `fs.mkdirSync`.
- Avoid using synchronous file system operations such as `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.mkdirSync` as they may block the event loop.
- Use more descriptive variable names to improve code readability and make the code more self-documenting.
- Add more comments to explain the purpose and functionality of the functions.
- Consider breaking down the `parseCliArgs` function into smaller functions to improve code modularity and maintainability.
- Consider using a third-party library such as `yargs` to handle command line argument parsing instead of manually parsing them.
- Add unit test cases for all functions to ensure proper functionality and prevent regression bugs.
- Consider using an `async` file system library such as `fs-extra` to simplify error handling and code readability.
