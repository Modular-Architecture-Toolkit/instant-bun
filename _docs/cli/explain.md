Technical description:
The module uses built-in Node.js modules such as `fs`, `path`, and `readline` to perform common CLI tasks. The functions are designed to be modular and reusable, with convenient abstractions for common actions such as file and directory creation, user input retrieval, and action selection. The `parseCliArgs` function supports a wide range of parameter types and allows for the specification of default values, making it suitable for use in a variety of CLI applications. Overall, this module provides a useful set of utilities for building command line interfaces in Node.js.
