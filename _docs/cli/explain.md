This file is a collection of utility functions related to file handling and command line argument parsing. 

Dependencies:
- "error-handler-validation"
- "fs"
- "path"
- "Bun" (assuming it is defined elsewhere)

Features:
- `getUserInput`: a function that uses a child process to get user input asynchronously and returns a promise that resolves with the input string.
- `parseCliArgs`: a function that takes command line arguments as input and returns a parsed object of key-value pairs. The keys are the flag names (without the "--" prefix) and the values are the flag values. If a flag doesn't have a value, its value is set to `true`.
- `createFileWithContent`: a function that creates a file with the given file path and content. If the directory for the file path doesn't exist, it is created. 
- `directoryExists`: a function that ensures the directory for the given path exists. If it doesn't exist, it is created. 
- `getModulesFromPath`: a function that returns an array of module names within the given directory path. 

The technical description of the module is that it provides a set of utility functions for file handling and command line argument parsing. These functions can be used in various file handling scenarios to ensure directories and files exist, get user input, parse command line arguments, and retrieve the names of modules within a directory.
