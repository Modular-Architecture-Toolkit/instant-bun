Some improvements that can be made to this module include:

1. Documentation: It is important to have detailed documentation for each function and type defined in the module. This helps developers who will be using the module to easily understand what each function does, what arguments it takes, and what it returns.

2. Better error handling: The error handling in this module can be improved by providing more descriptive error messages. For instance, when an error occurs during validation, the error type is always set to "invalid-type". It would be more helpful to differentiate between different types of errors such as missing keys, incorrect data types, or invalid data.

3. Testing: Each function in the module should have a corresponding test function that covers all possible input scenarios. This can help ensure that the functions work as expected and reduce the likelihood of bugs.

4. Code organization: The functions in this module could be organized better. For example, the createValidator function could be moved to a separate file and imported into errorUtils.ts to reduce the overall size of the file.

5. Consistency: There are inconsistencies in the error messages returned by the module. For example, the mapBuiltInErrorType function always returns "JavaScriptError" regardless of the actual error type. This inconsistency could confuse developers who use the module.
