This file is called errorUtils.ts and is responsible for handling and mapping different types of errors. It also contains a function for creating validators for a given schema.

Other modules it depends on are "./types", which contains type definitions for the input and output of the validator, as well as any other consumed or exported module.

Features of this module include:
- Defining an ErrorType type and a CustomError type representing structured errors with specific types and messages
- A constant object apiErrorMap for mapping error types to user-friendly error messages
- A function getErrorType that either returns the type of a CustomError or maps a built-in JavaScript error object to an ErrorType
- A function handleError that takes an error object and formats it as a CustomError, with an option to throw the error or return it
- A function createValidator that takes a schema and returns two functions, one for validating a single item against the schema, and another for validating an array of items against the schema. If validation fails, a ValidationError with a message is thrown.

Overall, this module provides helpful utilities for handling errors and validating input data against a given schema.
