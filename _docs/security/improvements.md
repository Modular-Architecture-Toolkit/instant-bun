There are a few improvements that could be made to this module:

1. Use a cryptographically secure random number generator instead of Math.random() to generate the key. This will increase the security of the key generated.

2. Use a larger key size (e.g. 64 or 128 bytes) for increased security. A 32-byte key may not provide enough entropy to prevent brute-force attacks.

3. Use a more diverse set of characters for the key, including special characters such as !@#$%^&*. This will increase the complexity of the key and make it harder to guess.

4. Consider using a different algorithm for generating the key, such as PBKDF2 or scrypt. These algorithms are specifically designed for key derivation and offer more security than a simple random string.

5. Consider adding a salt to the key generation process. This will add additional complexity to the key and make it even harder to guess.

6. Add types to the function signature to improve TypeScript support. For example, `function generateEncryptionKey(): string` could become `function generateEncryptionKey(): Buffer`.
