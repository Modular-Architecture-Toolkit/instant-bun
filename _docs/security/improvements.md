There are a few improvements that can be made to this module:

1. Instead of hardcoding the key length to 32, consider making it a parameter that can be passed in when calling the function. This allows for greater flexibility and customization depending on the specific use case. 

2. Consider using a more cryptographically secure method for generating random characters, such as the built-in `crypto` module in Node.js. This ensures that the generated key is truly random and cannot be easily guessed or brute-forced. 

3. It may be useful to add error handling in case of unexpected input or failures in the key generation process. 

Here is an example of how the improved module could look like:

```typescript
import crypto from "crypto";

function generateEncryptionKey(length: number = 32): string {
  const possibleChars =
    "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789";
  let key = "";
  try {
    for (let i = 0; i < length; i++) {
      const randomIndex = crypto.randomInt(0, possibleChars.length);
      key += possibleChars.charAt(randomIndex);
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Error generating encryption key: ${err}`);
  }
  return key;
}
```

In this implementation, we've added a parameter that allows the user to specify the length of the key they want, defaulted to 32. We've also replaced the random generator with the `crypto.randomInt` method for a more secure implementation. Finally, we've added error handling to catch any potential errors that may arise during the key generation process.
