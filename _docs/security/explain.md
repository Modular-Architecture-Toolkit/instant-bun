This file contains a single exported function called "generateEncryptionKey()" which generates a random string of 32 alphanumeric characters. It depends on just the JavaScript built-in Math and String methods.

Features of the module:
- Generates a random encryption key
- Uses a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and numbers
- Returns the key as a string

Technical description:
The "generateEncryptionKey()" function initializes a variable called "possibleChars" with a string containing all possible characters to use in the encryption key. It then loops 32 times and randomly selects a character from "possibleChars" using the Math.random() method and adds it to the "key" variable using the String.charAt() method. Finally, it returns the complete "key" string.
