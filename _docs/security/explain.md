## Module: `generateEncryptionKey.ts`

### Dependencies:
- None

### Features:
- `generateEncryptionKey()` function that returns a randomly generated encryption key string.

### Technical Description:
This module exports a single function `generateEncryptionKey()` which generates a random 32 character string consisting of alphanumeric characters. It achieves this by initializing a string `possibleChars` containing all the possible characters and then using `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` to select a random character for each of the 32 positions in the key. The selected character is added to the `key` string using the `+=` operator. Once all 32 positions have been filled, the function returns the generated `key` string.
