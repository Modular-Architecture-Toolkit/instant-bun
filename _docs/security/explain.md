# Module Explanation

## Dependencies

This module has no external dependencies.

## Features

- `generateEncryptionKey`: A function that generates a random encryption key.
  - Returns a string.
  - The string consists of 32 characters, randomly selected from a pool of letters (both upper and lower case) and numbers.

## Technical Description

This module exports a single function named `generateEncryptionKey`. When called, the function generates a random encryption key by selecting 32 characters from a pool of possible characters. The pool consists of 62 different characters, including both upper and lower case letters and the digits 0 through 9.

To generate the key, the function loops 32 times, each time adding one character to the key string. During each iteration, a random index is selected within the pool of possible characters using `Math.floor(Math.random() * possibleChars.length)`. The character at this index is then added to the key string using the `key += possibleChars.charAt(...)` syntax.

Finally, the function returns the completed key string.
