# Creating a Module in BNK (Bun Nookit)

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a new module for the BNK framework. Whether you're adding functionality like OAuth integration or something entirely different, these guidelines will help align the module with BNK's design philosophy and standards to ensure consistency.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with TypeScript and BNK's core concepts.
- Understanding of the problem domain the module will address.

## Step 1: Research and Requirements Gathering

Before coding, understand the scope and requirements of the module. For instance, if you're building an OAuth module, research the OAuth 2.0 protocol, and identify the primary use cases you want to support.

## Step 2: Designing the Module

### 2.1 Define the API

Design a clear and intuitive API for the module. Consider the functions and interfaces users will interact with.

### 2.2 Plan the Architecture

Ensure the module aligns with BNK's architecture. Use factory functions, avoid global state, and adhere to strong typing.

### 2.3 Security and Performance

Plan for security and performance from the start. This is especially important for modules handling sensitive data or requiring high efficiency.

## Step 3: Implementation

### 3.1 Setup

Set up the basic structure of the module. Create a new directory and files as needed within the BNK project structure.

### 3.2 Core Functionality

Develop the core functionality of the module. Keep functions short and focused, and use descriptive names.

### 3.3 Integration

Ensure that the module integrates seamlessly with other BNK components.

### 3.4 Error Handling

Implement robust error handling to make the module resilient and reliable.

## Step 4: Testing

Write comprehensive tests for the module. Cover unit testing for individual functions and integration testing for the module as a whole.

## Step 5: Documentation

Document the module thoroughly. Include a usage guide, example implementations, and a detailed API reference.

## Step 6: Community Feedback and Iteration

Release a beta version of the module and encourage feedback from the BNK community. Iterate based on the feedback received.

## Best Practices

- **Follow BNK's Coding Style**: Adhere to the principles outlined in BNK's coding guidelines, such as using `const`, writing pure functions, and avoiding premature optimization.
- **Use Descriptive Names**: Choose clear and descriptive names for functions, variables, and modules.
- **Write Efficient Code**: Focus on practicality and optimization where necessary. Prioritize clarity and simplicity.
